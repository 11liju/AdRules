## 🕹 Project Principle
 The project uses GitHub Actions to update and merge the latest rules every 12 hours every UTC time, and then push to GitHub Repo.
 Use the global accelerated CDN provided by the four websites to distribute the rules
 ①[FastGit](https://fastgit.org) (updated in real time)
 ②[Coding](https://coding.net) (updated in real time)
 ③[Jsdelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.net) (with cache)
 ④[Staticaly](https://staticaly.io) (with cache)
 In order to achieve the update of all advertising rules every second.

## 🍔 How to use
 **⚠️ Note: ** This rule is not for network proxy tools, do not use it for Surge, ShadowRocket, Quantumult(X), Clash(X/A) and similar tools!
 Just copy the acceleration address of the corresponding rule in the table below and use it as a link to the subscription rule of the advertising tool.
